    <h1>I don't like school</h1>
    <p>This is my statement about school</p>
  </div>

  <div class="statement">
    <p>When i was younger i actually liked school, I enjoyed being there
      Since 7 th grade my desision has changed. I do not enjoy school at at all, I think it is boring.
      I am not bullied or anything i got plenty of friends. However i have a favorite subject. Physical Education. I enjoy running and stuff like that.
      Something else i wanna tell you is. Every summer i do nothing. I am always sitting inside. Doing nothing, While my friends are being with each other.
      They have called me multiplie times this summer, My phone has been off while they were calling. I have not though or wanted to do anything with them or socialize with them.
      Because i am lazy. This summer might have been the worst. I have gained some weight. in the start of the summer i weighted about 63 - 64 KG now i weight 69 - 70 KGs somewhere around there.
      I have no stamina. I don't have energy to run or do anything. I am 15 years old. And i will change, I will  try
